---docs revamp---

I need a complete revamp of teh @docs @mkdocs.yml 

to completely document our project so far 

fill all markdown files and replace the redundant files and include any missing 

REMINDER THAT THIS IS A PERSONAL ARGOCD PROJECT SHOWCASING ALL MY KNOWLEDGE TO RECRUITERS

Th edocs shouldl be information and staright to the point 

with disclaimers etc and enpugh info so that there is no confusion at all 

here are some current project docs for reference 

@README.md @README.md @README.md @Taskfile.yml @Taskfile.gitflow.yml @. 


also use @web  if you want 

ONLY INCLUDE NECESSARY FILES THIS SHOULD BE COMPACT NOT TOO MANY PAGES JUST THE NECESSARY FOR A PERSONAL PROJECT. THIS IS NOT TOOL !!

JUST NECESSSARY DOCS PLEASE
